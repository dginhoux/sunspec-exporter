# Known Working / Tested Devices

Search (Sunspec Modbus Certified List)[https://sunspec.org/sunspec-modbus-certified-products/] for your device.

Because Sunspec is a standard, the configuration required, for the exporter, will vary only:

1. Which Modbus address the device listens on
2. The `model_ids` you need from the device (don't need the serial number 6 times a minute :-) )
3. Any custom filterng required

You won't need to map any data fields, the exporter does all that work.
